## Product Description

The Neuron Net DAX40 Trading Robot is an AI-powered forex software designed specifically for trading in the DAX40 market. It utilizes market indicators and patterns obtained from the Neuron Net DAX40 software to determine entry and exit signals. The trading algorithm uses artificial intelligence to analyze the market indicators and patterns and make informed trading decisions.

### Features

- Retrieves market indicators and patterns from the Neuron Net DAX40 software.
- Utilizes artificial intelligence to calculate entry and exit signals.
- Calculates stop loss and take profit levels based on the entry signal.
- Places buy or sell trades based on the entry signal.
- Closes trades based on the exit signal.

### How It Works

The Neuron Net DAX40 Trading Robot consists of several functions and global variables:

#### Global Variables

- `entrySignal` and `exitSignal`: Stores the entry and exit signals determined by the artificial intelligence.
- `stopLoss` and `takeProfit`: Stores the calculated stop loss and take profit levels.

#### Trading Function

The main trading function is `tradeDAX40()`. It performs the following steps:
1. Retrieves market indicators and patterns from the Neuron Net DAX40 software using the `getMarketIndicators()` and `getMarketPatterns()` functions.
2. Calculates the entry and exit signals using the `getEntrySignal()` and `getExitSignal()` functions.
3. Calculates the stop loss and take profit levels using the `calculateStopLoss()` and `calculateTakeProfit()` functions.
4. Places a buy or sell trade based on the entry signal using the `openBuyTrade()` and `openSellTrade()` functions.
5. Closes the trade based on the exit signal using the `closeBuyTrade()` and `closeSellTrade()` functions.

#### Supporting Functions

- `getMarketIndicators()`: Retrieves market indicators from the Neuron Net DAX40 software.
- `getMarketPatterns()`: Retrieves market patterns from the Neuron Net DAX40 software.
- `getEntrySignal()`: Calculates the entry signal using artificial intelligence based on market indicators and patterns.
- `getExitSignal()`: Calculates the exit signal using artificial intelligence based on market indicators and patterns.
- `calculateStopLoss()`: Calculates the stop loss level based on the entry signal.
- `calculateTakeProfit()`: Calculates the take profit level based on the entry signal.
- `openBuyTrade()`: Places a buy trade.
- `openSellTrade()`: Places a sell trade.
- `closeBuyTrade()`: Closes a buy trade.
- `closeSellTrade()`: Closes a sell trade.

#### Main and Testing Functions

- `OnTick()`: The main function that is called on each tick. It calls the `tradeDAX40()` function to perform the trading algorithm.
- `testDAX40()`: A testing function that can be used to test the trading algorithm on demo and real accounts.

#### Initialization and Deinitialization Functions

- `OnInit()`: The program entry point. It calls the `testDAX40()` function to run the testing.
- `OnDeinit()`: The program deinitialization point. It can be used to handle program deinitialization.
